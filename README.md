# VideoReTalking-HQ
VideoReTalking-HQ is an imptuve high-quality video retalking tool for enhancing and synchronizing video frames with audio inputs using advanced face enhancement techniques, including GFPGAN, and expression control.

## About

VideoReTalking-HQ, an enhaced system to edit the faces of a real-world talking head video according to input audio, producing a high-quality and lip-syncing output video.  The system disentangles this objective into three sequential tasks: face video generation with a canonical expression; audio-driven lip-sync; and face enhancement for improving photo-realism. Given a talking-head video, we first modify the expression of each frame according to the same expression template using the expression editing network, resulting in a video with the canonical expression. This video, together with the given audio, is then fed into the lip-sync network to generate a lip-syncing video. Finally, we improve the photo-realism of the synthesized faces through an identity-aware face enhancement network and post-processing. We use learning-based approaches for all three steps and all our modules can be tackled in a sequential pipeline without any user intervention.
